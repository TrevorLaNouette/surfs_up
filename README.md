# Surfs_Up - SQL Lite - Hawaiian Surf and Shake Shop Weather Analysis

## Analysis

Our friend and business partner W. Avy wants information about temperature trends before opening a surf and shake shop in Oahu. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


## Results:

## June Weather Statistics

## December Weather Statistics

- The difference in mean temperature between June (74.9) and December (71.0) is 3.9 degrees.
- The standard deviation in June (3.3) and December (3.7) show that temerature variation is relatively stable in both months
- The 25th percentile temp in June (73) and December (69) show that the temperatures between summer and winter months again are relatively stable and never get too cold.

## Summary:

Statistical analysis of the data show that temperature in Oahu, Hawaii is relatively stable throughout the year. The average temperature between June and December only fluctuates by 3.9 degrees which will allow for desirable surfing temperatures all year round. Further analysis of weather data should be conducted to look at other months of the year such as September and October when the trade winds decrease leading to elevated temperatures and stormy conditions because of the increased heat. I would want to query more information about the severity of storms during the stormy season as this would create dangerous conditions where surfing would not be optimal (For non-experts). Further analysis should also be conducted on the surf conditions to find how many days of the year per month that contain optimal surf conditions. This continued analysis would more fully describe the surfing conditions and thus business potential for a surf and shake shop in Oahu.
